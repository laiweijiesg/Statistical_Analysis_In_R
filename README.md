and how it affects the target label: Relative Position

In order to measure athletes' relative performance within their category accounting for the total number of participant per age  category a feature known as Relative Position(RelPos) was created.
The feature is a normalized measure of of an athlete's performance within their age category enabling fair comparisons across different age groups.
This variable provides insights into an athlete's standing relative to others in the same category accounting for variations in category sizes.
It also provides a measure of how an athlete's position compares to the highest position achieved within their respective age category.
